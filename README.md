# Claro

**Claro** is a web application inspired by the "We’re Not Really Strangers" cards. It offers a variety of card editions, each containing a series of thought-provoking questions on different topics such as self-love, friendships, self-discovery, etc. The primary goal of Claro is to provide users with an online space to reflect, learn more about themselves, and engage in self-improvement. The site also promotes user interaction by allowing them to share their thoughts and feedback.

## Features

- **Home Page:** Displays 3 different questions. Users can visit the “Editions” page to preview content but need to create an account or log in for full access.
- **Random Question:** Once logged in, users see a randomly generated question on the home page with each visit. They can respond to the question, and their answers are saved.
- **Editions Page:** Explore various card editions, access all cards, respond to questions, and view past responses.
- **Comments Section:** Users can comment on each card to share their reflections and interact with others.
- **My Answers:** Access, modify, or delete previously submitted answers.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the web pages.
- **SQL**: For database management.
- **PHP**: Procedural PHP for server-side logic.
- **Desktop Only**: Designed and optimized for desktop formats.

## Future Improvements

- **Profile Management:** Add functionality for users to update their profile picture and username.
- **Custom Card Editions:** Enable users to create their own editions of cards with personalized questions.
- **User Experience Enhancements:** Address design bugs and improve the overall user experience for a smoother interaction.
- **Refactoring to PHP MVC:** Potentially refactor the project using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for better code organization and scalability.
